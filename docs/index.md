# RoseLynn Family Documentation

Here you can find useful documentation regarding using components of the RoseLynn family.

## Disclaimer

Always consult the built-in documentation for the exact behavior of each of the components. Most details are clarified, and the APIs behave in a similar fashion to most already existing ones.

Almost every utility is publicly exposed and documented, for there might be cases where the end user might take advantage of them.

The packages are developed with C# code analysis in mind. VB or F# are not in the plans of being supported. Some components might find common grounds for other languages, but they are not intended to be used in such ways.
